    <h3>Retreat guidelines</h3>

    <p>
      We ask that everyone acknowledge a set of guidelines, which may include individuals identifying one’s desire to
      maintain social distance, overall social distance guidelines and wearing of masks in large and small group
      settings as required and/or requested.
    </p>

    <h4>Prayer and Program Spaces:</h4>
    <p>
      Indoor, non-boarding spaces will be used for small gatherings and will have a max capacity based on COVID
      guidelines at the time. We will gather in large indoor spaces as deemed appropriate based on those same
      guidelines and as weather dictates.  The facility has added a large (60’ x 120’) tent which will be used to
      accommodate larger group gatherings, as appropriate.
    </p>

    <h4>Masks:</h4>
    <p>
      All men must honor requests to wear a mask during indoor, non-socially distanced gatherings should they occur.
    </p>

    <h3>Updates to these guidelines</h3>
    <p>
      Specific protocols will be drawn up, and shared with the community, that support federal, state and local
      guidelines as we get closer to the retreat
    </p>

    <h3>Refunds</h3>
    <p>
      We understand that this overall situation may change, as well as your personal situation.  Refunds will be
      honored, minus a $50 processing fee, for cancellations no later than September 30, 2021.
